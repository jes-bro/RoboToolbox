## Path Planning

Path planning vocab:  
* A*&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8594; Finds the optimal path between  two points within a finite time period.
* RRT &#8594; A path planning algorithm that is faster than A*, but the path found is longer.  
   * RRT converges to a collision free path.
   * Algorithm can be developed using Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance calculations. There are pros and cons to each. 

## Pick and Place

Notes:  
* MATLAB Integrates with Gazebo. 

## Differential Drive
Differential drive robot:
* Movement is based on two separate driving wheels placed on either side of the robot chassis. 
* Diagram:

## MATLAB Toolbox Info -  Accelerating Robotics Algorithms with Code Generation

Inverse kinematics:  
* ik Codegen generates code for inverse kinematics algorithms so you don't have to

## Inverse Kinematics

What is it:  
* Inverse kinematics involves calculating variable joint parameters needed to place the end manipulator on a robotic arm in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain.
