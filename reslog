# MATLAB Robotics Toolbox - Log

### Day 0: December 21rst, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Conducted research on different features of the MATLAB Robotics Toolbox. Learned path planning vocabulary, differential drive systems, pick and place algorithms, dynamics properties and inverse kinematics. 

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot about the robotics toolbox in MATLAB, it seems like it has a lot of capabilities. Also looked into MATLAB C++ compiler, and one exists. Will link here once I recover the link.

2. [MATLAB C++ Compiler]()

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
